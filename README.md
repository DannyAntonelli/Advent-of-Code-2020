# Advent of Code 2020
A repository of my [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) solutions written in Python.

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is a yearly coding challenge created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). Every day, from Dec 1st to Dec 25th, a coding challenge is released and developes from all over the world can try to solve it with which programming language they prefer the most. This is the first year I tried to solve them.

## Here are my results!
